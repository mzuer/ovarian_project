We first assessed this performance in data from TCGA (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/), consisting of 582 HGSOC of various stages and 12 normal fallopian samples. As previously mentioned, TCGA data were obtained using Illumina's first-generation, HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, and thus validation was limited to the 16 probes (in 15 DMRs) in common between the 2 platforms.
